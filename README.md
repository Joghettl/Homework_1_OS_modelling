# Homework_1_OS_modelling
This is our first homework assginment in 'VU Open Source Energy System Modelling'.
In this repo the profiablity of PV-systems is examined. Therefore the net present value is calculated for different scenarios. 
The calculations have certain parameters, which include the load profile, the PV-energy production, grid tariffs and many more.
Furthermore the interestrate is dependent on the 'Matrikelnummer'.
