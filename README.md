# Homework_1_OS_modelling
This is our first homework assginment in 'VU Open Source Energy System Modelling'.
In this repo the profiablity of PV-systems is examined which is based on a homework from 'VU Selected Topic in Energy Economics and Environment'. 
Therefore the net present value is calculated for different scenarios. 
The npv is calculated for a house with a PV-system, withou a PV-system, with pure electricity purchase and no feedin-tariffs.
The calculations have certain parameters, which include the load profile, the PV-energy production, grid tariffs and many more.
These parameters can be adjusted. One function determines the annuities for the PV-system. The net present values of the PV-system can be compared to each other and the most lucrative setup can be found.
Furthermore the interestrate is dependent on the 'Matrikelnummer'.
